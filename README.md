# Cards

This is a simple practice project I made for learning basic usage of Blazor together with SignalR.

## Planning Poker

Planning Poker is a tool help estimating the scope of development tasks in agile teams. 

A game of planning poker goes as follow.

1. Team reads a task from their backlog
2. Each team member plays a card that corresponds to what they feel the relative size of that task is
3. Cards from the team members are revealed
4. Team works towards a consensus and discusses the different estimates given

The goals for this activity are to come up with reasonable estimates and to facilitate information sharing inside the team. Why does one team member see the task as smaller or larger than others? Maybe they have an insight they can share.
